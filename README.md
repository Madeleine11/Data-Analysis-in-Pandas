Exploratory data analysis with Pandas
# In this task you should use Pandas to answer a few questions about the Adult dataset.

# How many men and women (sex feature) are represented in this dataset?
# What is the average age (age feature) of women?
# What is the percentage of German citizens (native-country feature)?
# What are the mean and standard deviation of age for those who earn more than 50K per year (salary feature) and those who earn less than 50K per year?
#  Is it true that people who earn more than 50K have at least a high school education? (education â€“ Bachelors, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, Masters or Doctorate feature)
# Display age statistics for each race (race feature) and each gender (sex feature). Use groupby() and describe(). Find the maximum age of men of Amer-Indian-Eskimo race.
# Among whom is the proportion of those who earn a lot (>50K) greater: married or single men (marital-status feature)? Consider as married those who have a marital-status starting with Married (Married-civ-spouse, Married-spouse-absent or Married-AF-spouse), the rest are considered bachelors.
#  What is the maximum number of hours a person works per week (hours-per-week feature)? How many people work such a number of hours, and what is the percentage of those who earn a lot (>50K) among them?
# Count the average time of work (hours-per-week) for those who earn a little and a lot (salary) for each country (native-country). What will these be for Japan?
# Find out the total number of hours worked and mean salary as per different occupations.
